| CODE DESCRIPTION |
\------------------/

This Python script implements a simple numerical procedure for solving
Maxwell's electrostatic equations for the case of a spherical conductor with
a conical aperture. The problem is discussed in the following paper:

    Lamberti & Prato, 1991. Am. J. Phys., vol. 59, p. 68

See that paper for a complete description of the problem.


/-----------------------\
| SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS |
\-----------------------/

    - Python 3.x (http://www.python.org/)
        - Python 3 has been out for something like 3 years now. There is no
          reason to write new code in Python 2 syntax. Print is a function now,
          sorry.

    - matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
        - Standard Python plotting library.

    - SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/)
        - Scientific library for Python.

| PARAMETERS |
\------------/

There are a few parameters which, at the moment, are hard-coded in the Python
script itself. They are:

    alpha: the subtending the surface of the spherical conductor, *excluding*
           the aperture. Must be between 0 and pi.

    a: the radius of the sphere. Must be > 0.

    V: the (constant) potential held on the surface of the conductor. Can be
       positive or negative.
